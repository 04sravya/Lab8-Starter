**How are graceful degradation and service workers related?**
Graceful degradation is the ability to maintain limited functionality even when a large portion of the code has been destroyed or rendered inoperative. Service workers help achieve graceful degradation because if the user's internet goes out, they will still be able to access some functionality.
